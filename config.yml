  # Note: It is not possible to use the SpacyTokenizer + SpacyFeaturizer in
  #       combination with the WhitespaceTokenizer, and as a result the
  #       PERSON extraction by Spacy is not very robust.
  #       Because of this, the nlu training data is annotated as well, and the
  #       DIETClassifier will also extract PERSON entities .
